`strongpods` is a tiny and simple library for _Strongly typed Plain Old Data Structures_.

Using it you can simply create a PODS using a decorator and C-style typed attribute declaration:
```python
from strongpods import PODS

@PODS
class MyPODS:
    an_int: int
    a_list: list
```

You can then initialize it using keyword arguments and an exception will be raised if the provided values don't have the specified typed or cannot be cast/coerced to these types.
```python
pods_instance = MyPODS(an_int=127, a_str="brains") # works
pods_instance_2 = MyPODS(an_int="an irrational number", a_str="brains") # raises a ValueError because an_int cannot be converted to an int
pods_instance_2 = MyPODS(an_int="an irrational number", a_str="brains") # raises a ValueError because an_int cannot be converted to an int
```

## Comparison with other PODS solutions
<!-- Talk about TypedDict, dataclass and Pydantic -->
In the standard Python library, multiple solutions exist to create PODS.

`strongpods.PODS` has the following advantages over `typing.TypedDict`:
- the specified types of each attribute are enforced at initialization
- you can use inheritance mechanisms to define common set of attributes for several PODS
- the attributes are accessible as such, not via keys in a dict that you may not remember.
  This also allows IDEs to provide autocompletion.
- supports default values (defined as class attributes)

It supports a variety of types that are correctly handled as assured by CI tests:
- any type such that the provided value can be cast to it. This means most python base
  types, data structures and user defined classes that do require more that a single value
  in their initializer
- Enums (subclasses of `enum.Enum`)
- `typing.Union`
- `typing.Optional` (which amounts to `typing.Union[..., None]`

## Installation
```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/tudoroancea/strongpods.git@main#egg=strongpods
```

## Usage
### Error handling behaviors
The way the errors are handled depends on the value of the global parameter
`strongpods.VERBOSITY_LEVEL`:
- 0: all errors are ignored
- 1: warnings are raised via `warnings.warn`
- 2: errors are raised

You can manually change this value at any time in your code with
`strongpods.set_verbosity_level()`.

Here are the cases where an error can be raised: letâ€™s suppose we have defined a PODS `A`
with an attributed `a` of type `T` and that we initialize the instance of `A` with a dict
of keyword arguments called `kwargs`
- if a value for `a` is not present in `kwargs` **and** `a` not have a default value
  **and** `T` is not an Optional, a warning/error is raised
- if we cannot create an instance of `T` with the value `kwargs["a"]` , a warning/error is
  raised. The following specific cases are considered:
    - if `T` is an Enum and `kwargs["a"]` is not an instance of this enum and cannot be
      cast to `str`
    - if `T` is `Optional[U]` and `kwargs["a"]` cannot be cast to `U`
    - if `T` is `Union[U,...]` and `kwargs["a"]` cannot be cast to `U` or any other type in
      the union
    - in all other cases, if the cast `T(kwargs["a"])` fails
- if no default value was set for `a` and no value cannot be created from `kwargs["a"]`,
  we do not set the attribute `a` in the instance of `A`.
